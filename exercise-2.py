2 Annotation
Write a program that gets an English text as argument and annotates it. The program should create a new text file
for the annotation. The addition is to appear in the text in the form of the_DET.
The following annotations are to be made:
direct and indirect articles (the, a, an, that etc.) with DET
Personal pronouns (I, you, he etc.) with PRON (pronouns in the nominative range)
Numbers (1,199, etc.) with NUM addition: Number words such as six -> six_DET
You are welcome to use the two texts in the exercise folder for this task. The attached annotated_text.txt file
should serve as a pattern for the precision of the annotation. Control your program.
