"Landlord! I_PRON ve changed my_PRON mind about that_DET harpooneer.--I_PRON shan't sleep
with him_PRON I_PRON ll try the_DET bench here."

"Just as you_PRON please; I_PRON m sorry I_PRON can't spare ye a_DET tablecloth for a_DET mattress, and it_PRON s a_DET plaguy rough board here"--feeling of the_DET knots and
notches. "But wait a_DET bit, Skrimshander; I_PRON ve got a_DET carpenter's plane
there in the_DET bar--wait, I_PRON say, and I_PRON ll make ye snug enough." So saying
he procured the_DET plane; and with his_PRON old silk handkerchief first dusting
the_DET bench, vigorously set to planing away at my_PRON bed, the_DET while grinning
like an_DET ape. The_DET shavings flew right and left; till at last the_DET plane-iron came bump against an_DET indestructible knot. The_DET landlord was
near spraining his_PRON wrist, and I_PRON told him_PRON for heaven's sake to quit--the_DET bed was soft enough to suit me_PRON and I_PRON did not know how all the_DET planing
in the_DET world could make eider down of a_DET pine plank. So gathering up the_DET shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the_DET great stove in
the_DET middle of the_DET room, he_PRON went about his_PRON business, and left me_PRON in a_DET brown study.

I now took the_DET measure of the_DET bench, and found that_DET it_PRON was a_DET foot too
short; but that_DET could be mended with a_DET chair. But it_PRON was a_DET foot too
narrow, and the_DET other bench in the_DET room was about four_NUM inches higher
than the_DET planed one_NUM so there was no yoking them. I_PRON then placed the_DET first bench lengthwise along the_DET only clear space against the_DET wall,
leaving a_DET little interval between, for my_PRON back to settle down in. But I_PRON soon found that_DET there came_PRON such a_DET draught of cold air over me_PRON from under
the_DET sill of the_DET window, that_DET this plan would never do at all, especially
as another current from the_DET rickety door met the_DET one_NUM from the window,
and both together formed a_DET series of small whirlwinds in the_DET immediate
vicinity of the_DET spot where I_PRON had thought to spend the_DET night.

The devil fetch that_DET harpooneer, thought I_PRON but stop, couldn't I_PRON steal
a march on him_PRON bolt his_PRON door inside, and jump into his_PRON bed, not to be
wakened by the_DET most violent knockings? It_PRON seemed no bad idea; but upon
second thoughts I_PRON dismissed it_PRON For who could tell but what the_DET next
morning, so soon as I_PRON popped out of the_DET room, the_DET harpooneer might be
standing in the_DET entry, all ready to knock me_PRON down!

Still, looking round me_PRON again, and seeing no possible chance of spending
a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I_PRON began to think
that after all I_PRON might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against
this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I_PRON I_PRON ll wait awhile; he_PRON must be dropping
in before long. I_PRON ll have a_DET good look at him_PRON then, and perhaps we_PRON may
become jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling.

But though the_DET other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
and going to bed, yet no sign of my_PRON harpooneer.

"Landlord!" said I_PRON what sort of a_DET chap is he_PRON does he_PRON always keep such
late hours?" It_PRON was now hard upon 12 o'clock.
